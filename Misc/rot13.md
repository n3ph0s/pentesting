The following is a simple way to convert this in Bash if Internet Access isnâ€™t available using example text that is saved in file `data.txt`:

```
Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh
```

The following snippet uses `cat` and then a pipe to send it to `tr` to rotate the alphabet 13 characters:

```
$ cat data.txt | tr '[A-Za-z]' '[N-ZA-Mn-za-m]'
