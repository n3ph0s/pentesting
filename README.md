# Penetration Testing Notebook

## Introduction

This notebook is learnings about Penetration Testing and Red Teaming that I have come across as part of my continual learning and development.

I will use this notebook to write down how things work, tips and tricks and also as a reference book to find commands and also ways to get better at using everyday tools.  Certain sections may contain a TL;DR section with some ready made snippets that can be modified to steamline certain activities.

Please feel free to contribute / fork the repo.
